# Development of a Digital Twin model for a Water Supply System using the Asset Administration Shell metamodel.
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Digital Twin model for a Water Supply System (WSS) using the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) metamodel. The AAS is utilized to represent and manage the various components and subsystems within the water supply infrastructure.
## Overview
The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is a key concept in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. It is a standardized data model that represents information about a specific object, machine or industrial process in a detailed and structured manner. The main goal of AAS is to provide a comprehensive and interoperable digital representation of an asset, enabling more efficient and intelligent management of them within an industrial context.
The Water Supply System with Asset Administration Shell project focuses on creating a digital representation of a water supply infrastructure, allowing for efficient monitoring, maintenance, and analysis of the system components. The AAS metamodel is employed to structure and organize the information related to different subsystems.
 
## Features
- **Digital Twin Modeling:** Utilizes AAS to create a digital twin of the water supply system.
- **Subsystem Representation:** Each subsystem (e.g., raw water pumping, water transmission) is represented by its own AAS.
- **Interoperability:** Promotes interoperability and standardization through the use of AAS.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation on the structure, components, and interactions within the system.

## AAS of basic components

| AAS Name | Description | 
| -------------- | -------------- | 
| AAS_Pipe     | This AAS facilitates the management and optimization of the pipe within the plant. It contains information about its physical characteristics, operating condi-tions, maintenance, monitoring, and documentation and also a submodel called 'Connections,' which allows track-ing of the elements through which water enters and exits the pipe.     | 
| AAS_Tank     | This AAS includes information about its dimensions, location, operating condi-tions, and maintenance, enabling effec-tive management of the tank within the facility.    | 
| AAS_Valve     | This AAS is a comprehensive digital rep-resentation of a physical valve within an WSS. It provides data on the valve's type, position, operational parameters, maintenance history, and connections, facilitating efficient management and control of the valve's functions and per-formance in the system.  | 
| AAS_WaterPump     | This AAS allows representing one of the most found components in a WSS . It holds various telemetric and operational information, data about the pump's type, location, operational parameters, maintenance history, and connections that enables efficient management of pump usage.     | 
| AAS_PumpDriver    | This AAS is a detailed digital representa-tion of the electronic or mechanical de-vice used to control a pump within an industrial system. It includes infor-mation about the driver's type, control parameters, connections, and other rele-vant specifications, enabling effective management and monitoring of the driver to ensure the proper operation of the pump.     |
